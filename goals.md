What are the goals and values you would bring when learning good database design?


- more future proof database schema
- understand the tradeoffs between different design, and applying the right one for your usecase
- reduce cost (although storage is free, larger tables gets slower over time)
- design schemas that models you business logic well
- querying tables becomes more natural (when joining etc)
