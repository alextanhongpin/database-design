# Storing machine learning data

## Sentiment analysis and spam classification

For both the usecase above, we can choose to store the probability score, as well as the version trained. This will be more useful than storing the binary values (true/false), since we can define a different cutoff point depending on how many rows we want to mark as spam.

## Dynamic Pricing

For dynamic pricing, we can store the predicted value as time series too if needed, to get a better gauge of the estimates.
