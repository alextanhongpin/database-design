# Temporal Facts

Temporal databases includes mainly two time dimensions namely valid time and transaction
time. Valid time and transaction time can be merged to create bitemporal data.

- Valid time is the time period during which a fact is true with respect to the real world.
- Transaction time is the time period during which a fact stored in the database is considered
to be true.
- Bitemporal data combines both Valid and Transaction Time

Reference [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282835771_Checking_and_Verifying_Temporal_Data_Validity_Using_Valid_Time_Temporal_Dimension_and_Queries_in_Oracle_12C/fulltext/5680cdc108ae1975838b838a/Checking-and-Verifying-Temporal-Data-Validity-Using-Valid-Time-Temporal-Dimension-and-Queries-in-Oracle-12C.pdf).

For the example below, `system_period` refers to the transaction time, and `active_period` refers to the `valid time`.


Ideally, the system time is generated by default, e.g. `not null default now()`. The example below overrides the created at for illustration purpose.


Compared to history table which is immutable, the bitemporal table is mutable, because sometimes we want to deal with data correction in the past, e.g. updating an individual's address, which could be corrected later in future date. However, we do not want to delete all past data as they may be useful (or they might affect reporting in some ways, and the change is not captured which cause confusion).


The example below does not follow the original implementation of bitemporal... Instead, we take an easier shortcut.
- for any correction made, we just invalidate all the past data and set the deleted_at to the current time
- then, we recreate the new data with the corrected effective at time

```sql
create table if not exists users (
	id int generated always as identity,
	name text not null,

	primary key(id),
	unique(name)
);
insert into users (name) values ('john');

drop table if exists user_addresses;
create table if not exists user_addresses (
	id int generated always as identity,
	address text not null,
	user_id int not null,
	effective_at timestamptz not null default now(),
	created_at timestamptz not null default now(),
	deleted_at timestamptz,

	primary key(id),
	foreign key(user_id) references users(id)
);

-- One user can only have one effective address at a time.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_active_address_per_user ON user_addresses (user_id, effective_at) WHERE (deleted_at is NOT null);

-- The Customs recorded the following on the 12th
-- John is in Malaysia on the 1st Jan
