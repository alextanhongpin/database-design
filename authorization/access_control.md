- alternative is to create rules for user using trigger
- we can set config in postgres in a transaction, and only activate the trigger if certain rule is fulfilled

## Root user
Create the database as the root user. Then grant the user the database rights.

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO user@'%';
```


## Creating superuser

```
ALTER ROLE <user> SUPERUSER;
```
