# Temporal with single date column


- History table captures only events that happened in the past.
- In short, we are not allowed to modify the past.
- We can only add new events.
- effective at is the date when the fact is valid.
- If we add new entries that are effective in the future, as long as it has not happened yet, we can delete it.
- There is no concept of delete in history, we can however set the entry to `null` as a tombstone entry, to indicate it is no longer effective. We can however resume it in the future.
- For entries that requires correction in the past, use [facts table](temporal.facts.md).
- If the previous active value is the same as the new value, we should skip the update.
- Note the boundary, `[)` the `)` is exclusive.

## With Multiple Constraints


Similar to the above, but with compound primary key.

```sql
--- With multiple constraints

drop table if exists product_price_tiers cascade;

-- TODO: Create trigger to disallow editing once the the current time is greater than the effective at date, since price that is already active should not longer be editable.
create table if not exists product_price_tiers (
	id int generated always as identity,

	product_id int not null,
	min_quantity int not null,
	price int, -- Price is set to be nullable, which means it's deleted

	effective_at timestamptz not null default now() CHECK (effective_at >= now()), -- Can only insert future data
	created_at timestamptz not null default now(),

	primary key (id),
	foreign key (product_id) references products(id),
	unique (product_id, min_quantity, effective_at)
);


insert into products(name) values ('chair');
insert into product_price_tiers (product_id, min_quantity, price, effective_at) values
	(1, 1, 100, clock_timestamp()),
	(1, 1, 250, clock_timestamp()),
	(1, 1, 175, now() + interval '1 hour'),
	(1, 1, 200, timestamptz 'tomorrow'),
	(1, 1, null, now() + interval '2 hour'),
	(1, 1, 250, now() + interval '3 hour'),
	(1, 2, 100, clock_timestamp()),
	(1, 2, 250, clock_timestamp()),
	(1, 2, 175, now() + interval '1 hour'),
	(1, 2, 200, timestamptz 'tomorrow'),
	(2, 1, 100, clock_timestamp()),
	(2, 1, 250, clock_timestamp()),
	(2, 1, 175, now() + interval '1 hour'),
	(2, 1, 200, timestamptz 'tomorrow'),
	(2, 2, 100, clock_timestamp()),
	(2, 2, 250, clock_timestamp()),
	(2, 2, 175, now() + interval '1 hour'),
	(2, 2, 200, timestamptz 'tomorrow');


select * from product_price_tiers;

select
	id,
	product_id,
	min_quantity,
	price,
	effective_at,
	lead(effective_at, 1) over (partition by product_id, min_quantity order by effective_at asc), -- end_date
	tstzrange(
		effective_at, -- start date
		lead(effective_at, 1) over (partition by product_id, min_quantity order by effective_at asc), -- end_date
		'[)'
	) as active_period
from product_price_tiers;

drop view product_price_history;
create or replace view product_price_tier_history as (
	select
		id,
		product_id,
		price,
		min_quantity,
		tstzrange(
			effective_at, -- start date
			lead(effective_at, 1) over (partition by product_id, min_quantity order by effective_at asc), -- end_date
			'[)'
		) as active_period,
		created_at
	from product_price_tiers
	order by effective_at asc
);



select * from product_price_tier_history;

select *, active_period @> now() as is_current, price is null as inactive
from product_price_tier_history
where
	product_id = 1
	and min_quantity = 1;


-- How do we represent deleted at?
-- Allow setting the price to null, and filtering it later. So this creates a tombstone.


create or replace function freeze_past_product_price () returns trigger as $$
begin
	IF OLD.effective_at < now() THEN
		RAISE EXCEPTION 'ProductPrice<id=%, price=%, min_quantity=%, effective_at=%> is effective', OLD.id, OLD.price, OLD.min_quantity, OLD.effective_at
		USING HINT = 'Cannot change product price that is already effective';
		RETURN NULL;
	END IF;

	IF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN
		RETURN OLD;
	END IF;

	RETURN NEW;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER freeze_past_product_price
BEFORE UPDATE OR DELETE ON product_price_tiers
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE freeze_past_product_price();

delete from product_price_tiers where id = 2;
```

## Improvements


Astute readers will realize that the implementation above does not cover the time range from the beginning of time. Say if we insert two effective period, now and tomorrow

```
# What we got
now, tomorrow
tomorrow, until the end of time


# What we desired
from beginning, now
now, tomorrow
tomorrow, until the end of time
```


Attempting to use the `lag` window function instead of `lead` does not produce the desired result either:

```sql
create or replace view product_price_history as (
	select
		id,
		product_id,
		price,
		tstzrange(
			lag(effective_at, 1) over (partition by product_id order by effective_at asc),
			effective_at,
			'(]'
		) as active_period,
		created_at
	from product_prices
	where product_id =1
	order by effective_at asc
);
```

Output from `lag`:

```
from beginning, now
now, tomorrow
```

Even worse, it now limits the end time range to basically mean "effective until".


The solution is to allow `null` effective at as a marker for the beginning of time.


```sql
-- Special timestamp to indicate from the beginning of time.
alter table product_prices alter column effective_at drop not null;
insert into product_prices (product_id, price, effective_at) values (1, 200, null);
```


We also update our views to sort by `nulls first` (default is `nulls last`):

```sql
create or replace view product_price_history as (
	select
		id,
		product_id,
		price,
		tstzrange(
			effective_at,
			lead(effective_at, 1) over (partition by product_id order by effective_at asc nulls first),
			'[)'
		) as active_period,
		created_at
	from product_prices
);
```
