# Scheduling data vs just in time

When dealing with mutable data, we can update them immediately so that changes are immediate, or we sometimes want to schedule the changes to take into affect in the future.


Lets take an example of publishing products. The simplest design is to add a published at timestamptz column for postgres. Note that this is more useful than a boolean flag because you can schedule them. By that, it means you can set published date to Jan 2021, and the code chcecks if now is greater than published at, then display.

what if we want the post to be unpublished after a certain duration. This could happen for ads or job posting, where we are paid to display them for a certain duration. In this case, we need two columns, or in postgres, we can just use tstzrange and check if now overlaps with the valid time.


the just in time approach is simpler, in a way that you just manually publish or unpublish data. However, it may become unmanageable when table size grows.


# Present and the future

Lets look at a more complex example, ranking. You are running a campaign, and you display them according to rank on your application. 

At the moment, it's campaign Alpha and Beta, ranked 1 and 2 immediately. You received a request to include a new campaign Charlie to be scheduled next week.

You know what to so, just include a mew tstzrange column to publish it. But your PM wants it to be scheduled at first rank when its published, and Alpha to be ranked last. The new order should be Charlie, Alpha and Beta.

Here is the hard part - the validity doesnt say anything about the ranking changes. Ranking is done regardless of whether the campaign is active or not now.

We can rank Charlie to be first now, it just wont be visible, but we cant alter the ranking of Alpha to be last now as it should only take effect next week.

There are a few options
1. create another table containing ranking and reference to campaign and schedule the ranking changes, much complexity
2. run a cron to schedule (wont be visible on ui)
3. manually update next week
4. snapshot the data at the validity point - aka new json column with key date and value ranking. On read, check the column for date validity and override ranking, or run a cron to update when the column is not null

Other things to note
1. if ranking is unique, you need to defer the constraints, otherwise bulk update will conflict
2. for simplicity, rank new campaigns first, which is min rank minus one
3. allow negative rank to cheat 


# Row vs column scheduling

adding a tstzrange allows an entire row to be scheduled.

Column changes scheduling is not possible, unless you move that data to a separate row and do row scheduling.

# scheduling in application

Running Cron in application is probably the safest, and also easiest, since at times you need to rely on the business logic in the application too.

However, running it every minute might not be optimal 


Take for example, you want to run a Cron to delete stuff, one potential optimization is to schedule ahead.

You can do so by querying all future items to delete within the next hour, and then aggregate the IDs by the expired at date up to a minute granularity.

You can then schedule the Cron for the upcoming expiring minutes to clear the rows in the database.


# scheduling and data race

Scheduling work will always be prone to data race. Your state might change, or the rows may have already been deleted. As such, all operations must best be idempotent.

Care must be taken for changes that involves state transition. Always guard your transition so that states can't be shifted backwards
