# Slugs


Slugs are pretty common when designing web applications. Some use case includes generating a unique slug for users, or perhaps products or organizations, and maybe even article. Each has their own requirements.

Say if we have a user, we want to just navigate to the profile by visiting /users/john.doe. The user name does not change frequently (it should not change!). On the other hand, if we have an article content for blog, say Medium,, every time the user update the article title, the slug would have been dynamically generated. This is bad for the user experience, as well as us, because now when the user visits the old slug, the page would no longer be there. To mitigate this, we need to keep a historical slug for each changes (which again requires a lot of logic, since we need to ensure its unique, but at the same time does not prevent new articles from using the same slug).
The solution for this is to just slugify part of the title (mainly for SEO, though I'm hesitant to say it would make a huge difference), and then appending the article unique uuid behind the slug. When checking for article, we then need to just take the article uuid part to query from the database.

This example demonstrates how to generate the slug in the database, but you should consider placing this logic in your application instead if you need to deal with different locales and accents, this example assumes all text are just alphanumeric text.

## Creating slug with postgres function

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "unaccent";

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION slugify("value" TEXT)
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
  -- removes accents (diacritic signs) from a given string --
  WITH "unaccented" AS (
    SELECT unaccent("value") AS "value"
  ),
  -- lowercases the string
  "lowercase" AS (
    SELECT lower("value") AS "value"
    FROM "unaccented"
  ),
  -- remove single and double quotes
  "removed_quotes" AS (
    SELECT regexp_replace("value", '[''"]+', '', 'gi') AS "value"
    FROM "lowercase"
  ),
  -- replaces anything that's not a letter, number, hyphen('-'), or underscore('_') with a hyphen('-')
  "hyphenated" AS (
    SELECT regexp_replace("value", '[^a-z0-9\\-_]+', '-', 'gi') AS "value"
    FROM "removed_quotes"
  ),
  -- trims hyphens('-') if they exist on the head or tail of the string
  "trimmed" AS (
    SELECT regexp_replace(regexp_replace("value", '\-+$', ''), '^\-', '') AS "value"
    FROM "hyphenated"
  )
  SELECT "value" FROM "trimmed";
$$ LANGUAGE SQL STRICT IMMUTABLE;
```

Run:
```sql
-- Having to escape the quote here to demo...
select slugify('The World''s "Best" Caf√©s!');
```

Trigger on `create` (see notes):

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION public.set_slug_from_title() RETURNS trigger
    LANGUAGE plpgsql
    AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.slug := slugify(NEW.title);
  RETURN NEW;
END
$$;
```

Attach trigger:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER "t_news_insert" BEFORE INSERT ON "news" FOR EACH ROW WHEN (NEW.title IS NOT NULL AND NEW.slug IS NULL)
EXECUTE PROCEDURE set_slug_from_title();
```

Best practices:
- create slug only during create, and if it is not provided. We can use trigger to create a default slug, or `COALESCE(NULLIF($1, ''), slugify($1))`
- don't update slug when you update the name - it will cause urls to be broken, unless you have a mechanism to prevent that. Take a look at rail's history slug implementation. Note that this can be tricky too in a lot of situation, because once a slug becomes history, we need to ensure it will no longer be used by other entity. Else it could cause infinite redirect.
- the function does not handle duplicate slugs, we can append a number behind (make sure it's not the count of the number of similar slugs!, else when one of them is removed, it will cause problem. e.g. hallo1, hallo3, hallo4 will always cause duplicate, since the count will always be three).

## Unique slug with incrementing counter

Say that you are given a task to implement unique slug in your existing application:

Hypothesis:
- we can add unique constraints on slugs in the database
- we can write a function to increment the counter when the same slug exists, e.g. john-doe, john-doe-1

Slugs should be case insensitive (ideally lowercase), so we will be working with the `citext` extension, which stands for case-insensitive extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION citext;

-- Use a unique namespace.
CREATE SCHEMA slugs;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS slugs.slug (
	id serial primary key,
	name citext unique NOT NULL,
	counter int NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
	id serial PRIMARY KEY,
	slug citext UNIQUE NOT NULL
);
```

Let's add a function `increment` under the namespace `slugs`. This function does the following:

- upsert into the slug table, if it already exists, increment the counter
- if the counter is 0 (the first entry), return the slug as it is
- else, increment it, and add the counter suffix to the slug

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION slugs.increment(name text) RETURNS text as $$
	INSERT INTO slugs.slug (name)
		VALUES (name)
	ON CONFLICT (name)
	DO UPDATE 
		SET counter = slug.counter + 1
	RETURNING 
		CASE 
			WHEN counter = 0 THEN name 
			ELSE format('%s-%s', name, counter) 
		END 
	AS slug
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;
```

We can also add a basic utility function to just check if the slug exists (it's not thread safe, so it might return false positive, e.g. slug might be entered the next time user call this function):
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION slugs.exists(name text) RETURNS boolean AS $$
	SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM slugs.slug WHERE name = $1);
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;
```

Test:
```sql
SELECT slugs.increment('jane-doe');
SELECT slugs.exists('john');

INSERT INTO users (slug)
VALUES (slugs.increment('john'))
RETURNING *;
```

To check all functions created under this namespace:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE specific_schema = 'slugs';
```
