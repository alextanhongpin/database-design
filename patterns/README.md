Common design patterns in postgres. This does not cover relationships (one to one, one to many etc)


- constraints pattern
- trigger patterns
- bulk patterns
  - defer trigger
- state machine pattern
- single reference pattern
- polymorphism
- error 
- status pattern
- ordering pattern
- worker pattern
- slowly changing dimension
- timeseries
- counter pattern


Todo
- classify patterns by usecases (creational, constraints, updates)
- add problem statement, and scenarios
- add options for different database size. Larger tables usually requires more effort.
