# Column Naming

We can categorise columns into different usage

- user generated: name, body, description
- system generated: id, created at, updated at, deleted at
- inferred: generated from another column
- indexes: vector or fulltextsearch columns
- metadata: jsonb columns

Column names should be
- lowercase
- separated by underscore (snake case)
